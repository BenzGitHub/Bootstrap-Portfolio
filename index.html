                      My name is Ben Zamora. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp. This is my first homework assignment. The bootcamp is as fun as it is challanging. I am learning A LOT. But, the biggest lesson I've learned is how much I <i>don't</i> know!
                    </p>            
                    <p>My first, second, and third favorite past time is hanging out with my family! They are my support system; but also the funniest, smartest, most insightful, and interesting people I know. Normally, at this point I'd make crack about putting up with our two dogs. But just between you, me, and the internet: those two aren't just growing on me. They got me wrapped around their little paw!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the rarest of occasions (I assume it's similar to finding a unicorn), I like to game on the PS4. Admittedly, this coding bootcamp has ruined gaming a little bit for me. My mind is blown just trying to code this simple website. It rocks my world to think of everything involved in coding a AAA PS4 game!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've learned a lot, been aggravated, baffled, and at least once thought I was witnessing sorery. I can't wait to see what's next!
